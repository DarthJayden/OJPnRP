Description:

New OJP Features in V1.2:

-New Force Grip physics:
Manipulate the world and players around you with the new and improved Force Grip.
You are now able to throw, push, pull, swing and bat players into other players and
enjoy the physics that come into play when your opponent gets thrown to his death.

-New effects:
Both movie-like, realistic and improvised effects drawing influences from the Old Trilogy 
and the Kotor series. Smoke effects and explosions have never looked better in a Jedi Knight game.

-Overhauled Force power systems (Force Physics):
The majority of Force powers and their systems have been either completely re-done or
tweaked to suit OJP's subtle combination of movie-realism and balanced gameplay.
Push is not just useful for pushing opponents to the ground, but also for crushing them with other opponents,
items, and throwing them off of ledges. Speed will allow you to make proper use of your Jedi reflexes, and at high levels,
will allow you to react to anything at very fast pace.

-New and improved saber combat:
Old tried-and-tested combat styles in completely new packages, wrapped in glitter paper and finished off with a curly red ribbon.
Lightsaber duels have never been so exciting, nor have they visually been as attractive as they are now. All styles have been reconfigured
to suit their metaphorical descriptions and Star Wars namesake; fight as Dooku, with his notorious Makashi style and force your
opponent to his or her knees with a few simple strokes of the lightsaber. Batter your enemy into submission with a much-improved,
fast-comboing Djem-So or outsmart them with the many fakes and feints of Juyo. All of this put into a system that has
incorporated fakes, power attacks, running power attacks, ripostes, bounces, freezes, disarms and knockdowns into its repertoire.

-Old and forgotten skills made useful:
Saber throw is one of the Force powers we've restored to its former glory; hit those hard to reach targets with a controllable,
spinning disc of death. Empower your Jedi avatar with the Force Sense power, which will increase your Force capabilities by 
a 25% magnitude, in turn allowing you to make use of your Force powers longer.
More powers will be improved upon and added in the future.

-Skills and skill upgrades
With the brand-spankin' new experience and skill system, it's not only possible to buy powers and guns, but also to increase one's
prowess with a certain gun by buying upgrades for it. Upgrades include improvements in accuracy, rate of fire, damage, shot amount
and ammo drain. In future releases, all blasters will be upgradeable and customizable.

-CoOP Gametype and single player maps:
Nearly all singleplayer maps can be played on with any amount of players. NPC's and cutscenes are present and working, and OJP's
systems complement CoOP gameplay well.

-Deflection:
It is now not only possible to deflect and reflect, but also to manually reflect shots back at your opponent. This is done by slashing at shots
and will work with any aggressive style. For a tiny bit of damage and fatigue, your enemy's shots will fly straight to wherever you aim your slash at.
Counterattacking via deflect is now a viable strategy for gunner to jedi combat.

...and much more!


Installation:

Install file:

1) 
Run the installer and be sure to select your Jedi Academy directory. The installer
will put the files in the right place, which would be %:/%/Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy/Gamedata/ ojpenhanced.


Files in a zip:

1)
Unzip:
enhancedstuff.pk3
enhanceddlls.pk3

Into your %/gamedata/ojpenhanced folder.

2)
Unzip:
runojpenhanced.bat

Into your %/gamedata/ folder.

You can now create a shortcut of your runojpenhanced.bat file and run the mod with it. Be sure to use this method
as the only way to start OJP to avoid bugs and other problems.


Known errors:

Q1) My walking and running animations are very chuggy and unsmooth.
Q2) Some Force powers are missing from the list!
Q3) I can't spawn for some reason!

A) The server's files differ from yours. If the server is up to date, it is possible that something went wrong
when you installed the mod. Reinstall it and check whether you've removed all of your previous files and have only
ONE set of enhancedstuff and enhanceddlls.

Q4)The main menu is borked!
A)You entered a server using all-seeing-eye, or you loaded the mod using JKA's mod-loading set up. Run OJP with the .bat and nothing else.
